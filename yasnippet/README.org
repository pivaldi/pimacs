#+title: PIMacs/yasnippet Doom Module

This module configures [[https://github.com/joaotavora/yasnippet][YASnippet]] with custom key bindings and enables
stacked snippet expansions.

* Features

- Stacked expansions: snippets can trigger other snippets (=yas-triggers-in-field=)
- Rebinds snippet expansion from TAB to F3 (unless =+no-keys= option is used)

* Module Options

- =+no-keys= : Keep the default TAB binding for snippet expansion instead of F3.

* Key Bindings

Default (without =+no-keys=):

| Key     | Command       | Description              |
|---------+---------------+--------------------------|
| =<f3>=  | ~yas-expand~  | Expand snippet at point  |

The default TAB binding is removed to avoid conflicts with completion and
indentation.

* Usage Example

#+begin_src text
;; In init.el:
(doom! :pimacs
       yasnippet          ;; Use F3 for expansion
       ;; or
       (yasnippet +no-keys) ;; Keep TAB for expansion
       )
#+end_src
