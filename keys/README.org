#+title: PIMacs/keys Doom Module

This module configures useful key bindings in =global-map=.
See [[file:keys-key-bindings-refcard.org][the key bindings refcard]] for =+azerty= keyboard bindings.

* Features

- Removes the Doom advice on =newline-and-indent= for continuing comments;
  use =M-<RET>= instead for this feature
- Remaps =dabbrev-expand= to =hippie-expand=
  (see [[https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/text-expansion-hippie-expand][Text Expansion with Hippie Expand]])

* Notes

- Generate the refcard of all PIMacs key bindings with =pim-keys-bindings-to-refcard=
- With a /qwerty/ keyboard, the key bindings will be different

*Pull request is welcome to provide other keyboard support, Evil support, or
improve the existing.*
