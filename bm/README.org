#+title: PIMacs/bm Doom Module

This module install and configure the package /bm/ : the
[[https://github.com/joodland/bm][Visual Bookmarks for GNU Emacs ]].\\
It provides visible and *buffer local* bookmarks with the ability to jump
forward and backward to the next bookmark in the current buffer.

To navigate across buffers with bookmarks, it's better to use the native Emacs
bookmark.

* Key Bindings

By default, this module binds the /bm/ commands on the key =f2=, overwriting the
default Doom bindings for two columns editing (which I don't use).//
If you don't want this overwriting, add the option =+no-key-bindings= loading this
module.

- =f2= : jump to next visible buffer local bookmark.
- =S-<f2>= : jump to previous visible buffer local bookmark.
- =C-f2= : jump to previous visible buffer local bookmark.
- =s-<f2>= : toggle visible buffer local persistence.
