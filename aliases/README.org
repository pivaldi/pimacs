#+title: PIMacs/aliases Doom Module

This module defines short command aliases starting with =_= for frequently used
Emacs commands, making them quicker to invoke via =M-x=.

* Features

- =_ll= : ~visual-line-mode~ - Toggle visual line mode for long lines.
- =_rb= : ~revert-buffer~ - Revert the current buffer to its saved state.
- =_ar= : ~align-regexp~ - Align text based on a regular expression.
- =_gf= : ~grep-find~ - Search for a string in files recursively.
- =_rg= : ~consult-ripgrep~ - Search with ripgrep using consult interface.
- =_ff= : ~find-name-dired~ - Search for files by name recursively.
- =_ib= : ~ibuffer-list-buffers~ - Display buffer list in another window.
- =_sir= : ~string-insert-rectangle~ - Insert string on each line of rectangle.

* Additional Configuration

This module also replaces the default =yes-or-no-p= prompt with =y-or-n-p=,
allowing you to answer confirmation prompts with just =y= or =n= instead of
typing out =yes= or =no=.
