#+title: PIMacs/default Doom Module

The default minimal configuration of Emacs by PIMacs.

*This module must be loaded with your keyboard configuration*, =+azerty= and
=+qwerty= are supported for now. All other PIMacs modules will consider this
option when making the best ergonomic key bindings depending on the keyboard

*Pull request is needed to support Evil key bindings.*
