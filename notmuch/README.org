#+title: PIMacs/notmuch Doom Emacs Module

This package provide extra configurations of the default /Doom Emacs/
configuration for [[https://notmuchmail.org/][Notmuch]].

* IMPORTANT NOTES
- The /bash/ script [[mail-sync.sh]] is an example of IMAP synchronization with
  [[https://github.com/gburd/isync][isync/mbsync]] and /Notmuch/ tagging for my
  personal usage.
  - ~mbsync~ use the completly personnal config file ~~/.isyncrc~ symlinked to
    [[.isyncrc]] for educational purpose and showing best security practices.
  - /Notmuch/ tagging use the file [[.notmuch-tagging]] through the symlink from
    ~~.notmuch-tagging~ allowing you to use your own tagging config inspired by mine.
- The configured email directory is ~~/.mail~, use a symbolic link to your
  existing email directory if needed.
