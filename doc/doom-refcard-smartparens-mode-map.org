* Keymap =smartparens-mode-map=
Keymap used for ‘smartparens-mode’.

- =C-M-a= calls =sp-beginning-of-sexp= : jump to beginning of the sexp the point is in.
- =C-M-b= calls =sp-backward-sexp= : move backward across one balanced expression (sexp).
- =C-M-d= calls =sp-down-sexp= : move forward down one level of sexp.
- =C-M-e= calls =sp-end-of-sexp= : jump to end of the sexp the point is in.
- =C-M-f= calls =sp-forward-sexp= : move forward across one balanced expression.
- =C-M-k= calls =sp-kill-sexp= : kill the balanced expression following point.
- =C-M-n= calls =sp-next-sexp= : move forward to the beginning of next balanced expression.
- =C-M-p= calls =sp-previous-sexp= : move backward to the end of previous balanced expression.
- =C-M-u= calls =sp-up-sexp= : move forward out of one level of parentheses.
- =C-M-w= : Jump to beginning of the sexp the point is in then kill the sexp respecting delimiters. #pim
- =C-M-S-r= : Rewrap the enclosing expression with a different pair. #pim
- =C-M-<backspace>= calls =sp-splice-sexp= : unwrap the current list.
- =C-S-b= : Move point to the next position that is the begining of a symbol. #pim
- =C-S-f= : Move point to the next position that is the end of a symbol. #pim
- =C-<backspace>= : Delete a word backward, skipping over intervening delimiters. #pim
- =C-<delete>= : If word at point delete it and if paired char at point unwrap sexp. #pim
- =M-k= : Kill the balanced expression preceding point. #pim
** Prefix =C-c= : +prefix
