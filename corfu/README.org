#+title: PIMacs/corfu  Doom Emacs Module

This Doom Emacs package provide some extra configuration of the package
[[https://github.com/minad/corfu][Corfu -- COmpletion in Region FUnction --]]

* Features
- Disable auto-completion by default : auto-completion when I need it only.
- Remap =TAB= key to =M-<SPACE>= because =TAB= is over used (indent,
  completion, snippet and others).
- Enable Corfu in the minibuffer

* Thanks
Largely inspired by https://hieuphay.com/doom-emacs-config/
